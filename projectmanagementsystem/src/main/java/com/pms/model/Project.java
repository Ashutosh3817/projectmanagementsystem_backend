### CascadeType.ALL
The cascade attribute defines which operations should be cascaded from the parent entity to the associated child entities. The value CascadeType.ALL means that all operations (e.g., persist, merge, remove, refresh, detach) should be cascaded. In other words, when you perform an operation on a parent entity, the same operation will be applied to all its associated child entities. Here's a breakdown of the cascading operations:

- *PERSIST*: When the parent entity is saved, all its children are also saved.
- *MERGE*: When the parent entity is updated, all its children are also updated.
- *REMOVE*: When the parent entity is deleted, all its children are also deleted.
- *REFRESH*: When the parent entity is refreshed from the database, all its children are also refreshed.
- *DETACH*: When the parent entity is detached from the persistence context, all its children are also detached.

### orphanRemoval = true
The orphanRemoval attribute is used to automatically remove child entities that are no longer referenced by the parent entity. 
If orphanRemoval is set to true, when a child entity is removed from the parent entityâ€™s collection (or set to null), it will be 
deleted from the database. This is useful for ensuring data integrity and avoiding orphaned records.
